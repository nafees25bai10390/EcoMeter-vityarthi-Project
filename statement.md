# Project Statement: EcoMeter - Vehicle Emission Tracker

## 1. Problem Statement
With the increasing threat of climate change, transportation remains one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions. However, most individuals are unaware of the specific environmental impact of their daily commutes. There is a lack of simple, accessible tools that allow users to quantify their personal carbon footprint based on their specific vehicle and fuel usage.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The EcoMeter project is a desktop-based application designed to calculate, track, and analyze CO2 emissions.
* **In Scope:** * Calculating emissions for Cars, Bikes, and Buses using standard fuel factors.
    * Saving trip history to a local CSV file.
    * Providing an "Impact Analysis" by converting CO2 mass into trees required.
* **Out of Scope:** * Real-time GPS tracking.
    * Integration with live traffic data.

## 3. Target Users
* **Daily Commuters:** Individuals wishing to track their personal carbon footprint.
* **Eco-Conscious Students:** Users studying environmental impact who need a quick estimation tool.

## 4. High-Level Features
* **Emission Calculator:** Instant computation of CO2 based on distance/fuel.
* **Trip History Log:** A persistent record of past trips.
* **Eco-Impact Dashboard:** Visual analysis showing "Trees Needed to Offset".
